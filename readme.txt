Show customized translations of your posts or pages for visitors from other nations.

== Description ==

Are you welcoming visitors from different countries on your site and don't know how to serve all of them the best possible reading experience? Then just give Lingo a spin and you won't regret it.

A the best of it: You don't need to even think about accomplishing this, the plugin does all of that work for you. The **only thing** you need to do is provide a translated version of each post you would like to show in multiple languages and there you go: Everything works right out of the box. There's no need for configuring - it just works.

= Functionality =

The plugin provides you with a clean, simple workflow on how to create translations. After you've chosen a specific post which you want to translate, you just need to click 'Translate' on the post overview. Then Lingo will create a complete copy of the post and assign it a special post type so that it's completely isolated from normal posts.

After that, you'll see an edit screen that looks nearly exactly like the one for your original post. You can use the WYSIWYG-Editor, all types of metaboxes and so on. After providing a translation you just need to pick the suitable language and hit 'Save'.

> Support for [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com) will soon be added.

= Supported Languages =

Lingo currently makes use of all languages that are available on the 'Site Language' select-field in the admin area of your site ('Settings' > 'General' > 'Site Language' ). But don't get me wrong: It doesn't matter how many languages are installed on your site, Lingo works with all of them anyway.
